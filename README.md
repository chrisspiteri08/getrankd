# GetRankd

A very simple alternative to [rankade](https://rankade.com) that I created because I didn't want to wait
excessive amounts of time (IE an hour) in order to see score changes when a new match is added.

It has no security and no CSS.

## Running

You'll need to make sure your GOPATH is setup correctly.
Then `go run main.go` and `go get` any imports that complains about.
